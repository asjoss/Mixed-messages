#My Mixed messages project

For this project I am going to build a message generator program so everytime a user runs it
a new random message will be generated and displayed on the webpage.

To build this I am going to use HTML, CSS & JavaScript. The type of message I want my program 
to produce is a __Bad Advice__.

For weboage interface i will create a button that when clicked will generate and display text
below the button with both the button and text centered on the screen.
