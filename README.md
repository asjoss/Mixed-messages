# My Mixed Messages project

For this project I am going to build a message generator program. Anytime a user runs the program
a new random message will be generated and displayed on the webpage.

To build this I am going to use HTML, CSS & JavaScript. The type of message I want my program 
to produce is a __Bad Advice__quote.

For the webpage interface I will create a button that when clicked, will generate and display text
below the button, with both the button and text centered on the screen.
